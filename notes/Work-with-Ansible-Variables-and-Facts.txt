1 - Ansible variables
* Review on naming convetion and quotes
* Some more places to define variables:
  * vars, var_files and var_prompt
  * Commandline: ansible-playook play.yml -e '{"myVar":"myValue","anotherVar":"anotherValue"}'
  * Roles, blocks, and inventories
* Essential variable use:
  * - debug: msg="Look! I'm using my variable {{ myVar }}!"
* A note on quotes:
  * name:"{{ package }}"




2 - Dictionary variables
* Yaml formatting allows for python style dictionaries to be used as variables
	employee:
	   name: bob
	   id: 42
* There are two formats to access dictionary values:
	* employee['name']
	* employee.name
* The bracket syntax is safer as the dot notation can have collisions with python in certain circumstances


3 - Magic variables and filters
* Ansible defines several special variables knowns as magic variables
* You can use the variable 'hostvars' to look at facts about the other hosts in the inventory
	- {{ hostvars['node1']['ansible_distribution'] }}
* There is also a 'groups' variable that provides inventory information
	- {{ groups['webservers'] }}
* Jinja2 filters can be useful in manipulating text format
	- see: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/#builtin-filters
	{{ groups['webservers']|join(' ') }}
